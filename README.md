## üìö Study Tips

### For First-Time Learners
1. **Follow the order:** Start from Part 0 and progress sequentially
2. **Practice regularly:** Aim for 30-60 minutes daily rather than cramming
3. **Type, don't copy:** Manually type code examples to build muscle memory
4. **Break and rebuild:** Intentionally break examples to understand error messages

### For Exam Preparation
1. **Review exam objectives:** Cross-reference with [official exam review guide](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate)
2. **Time yourself:** Practice completing tasks within time constraints
3. **Focus on weak areas:** Use practice exam results to identify gaps
4. **Understand 'why':** Don't just memorize‚Äîunderstand the reasoning behind each concept

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping the exercises (hands-on practice is crucial!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not cleaning up AWS resources after practice
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Memorizing without understanding underlying concepts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ignoring state file management best practices
